turtle-frac
===========

utils.py - a bunch of short functions that might come in usefull!! (Random number generator, command shortener etc)
          
fractastic.py - A fractal generator with python's turtle module

example.py - The beginning of my entry showing how you might use some of the tools in utils.py. 

stereo_short.py - Draws a stereogram with part of the mandelbrot set in ~50 Lines

stereo.py - Same as stereo_short but commented nicely with some extra functions and an option to see the result fast with matplotlib (usefull for testing).
